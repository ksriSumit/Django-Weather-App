# Django Weather App

### Hi all, I have recently learnt Django for backend Developement and built a weather app.
### You can pull this project and run it in your machine.
### I have used openweatherapp API to get weather Information of different cities. You can make maximum of 50 API Calls in a day.
### You can also use your own API Key and tweak the code of project to get weather information of 10 days in Advace.


##Thank You :)
